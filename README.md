Septajawn
====================

A simple webapp dedicated to easily find schedule times for Septa's subway system. The primary goal of the app is to be as accessbile as possible. This is achieved with: an intutive UI, lightweight and responsive to operate on many devices and no monetary barrier.

Currently, the best way to find subway times online is through Septa's website (ex: http://www.septa.org/schedules/transit/w/MFL_1.htm). These matrices of times have obvious UI/UX and aren't adequately accessible on any devices, including desktops. Other alternatives include native apps to iOS and Android. However, these solutions require users to download an app (not always free) and aren't cross platform, which shrinks the possible userbase.

To me, this project served as an exercise to learn Javascript, jQuery, fundamentals of mobile webapp design. And hopefully the best practices as well. Admitedly, some of the code might seem hackish.
