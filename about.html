					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Septajawn is an online Septa subway scheduling application. The aim is to be as </p>
					<p>Created by Will Vedder as the Capstone project for his bachelor degree at Temple University.</p>
					<p>The project is open source, and can be viewed on the Septajawn github. You're encouraged to download, fork, push the project. If you think this app sucks, then say so in the feedback section.</p>
					<h2>Technical Details</h2>
					<p>Septajawn is built upon the Backbone.js framework and utilizes the default dependencies (Underscore, jQuery). All the data is pulled from a custom made JSON file.</p>
					<p>Aside from the project's altruistic goals, performance was the primary consideration during development. The idea being, the faster and more lightweight the application, the more devices that could adequately run it, thus fulfilling the accessiblity goals. Originally the project was built without a framework or particular organization. Despite the application functioning as needed, the performance wasn't deemed adequate. Thus, the app was re-written from the ground up in Backbone. The perfomance gains from the reconstruction were substantial.</p>
