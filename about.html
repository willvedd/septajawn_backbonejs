					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Septajawn is an online Septa subway scheduling application. The goal of the project is to deliver a high-quality product that is as accessible and inclusive as possible. In this context, that means functioning adequately on many devices, no monetary barriers, and accessible to those with disabilities. Septajawn was designed and developed by Will Vedder as the Capstone project for his bachelor degree at Temple University.</p>
					<p>The project is open source, and can be viewed on the <a href="https://github.com/willvedd/septajawn_backbonejs">Septajawn github</a>. You're encouraged to download, fork, push the project. If you think this app sucks, feel free to transmit your rage via email at <a href="mailto:yo@septajawn.com">yo@septajawn.com</a>.</p>
					<p>Septajawn is built upon the <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> framework and utilizes the default dependencies (Underscore, jQuery). All the data is pulled from a custom made JSON file. Project hosting utilizes github's free gh-pages service. </p>
		
					<!--This JSON file was custom created by copying taking Septa's scheduling data and passing it through Excel. This step was necessary because the way the schedule is formatted, the data cannot be copied directly into a text-editor. Instead, Excel reformats the way the data is organized on the clipboard. Once in the text-editor, a mass search and replace opeartion was executed on the thousands of data points to convert the raw data into a format that the application could interpret.

					<p>
					<p>Aside from the project's altruistic goals, performance was the primary consideration during development. The idea being, the faster and more lightweight the application, the more devices that could adequately run it, thus helping fulfil the accessiblity goals. Originally the project was built without a framework or particular organization. Despite the application functioning as needed, the performance wasn't deemed adequate. Thus, the app was re-written from the ground up in Backbone. </p>

					The perfomance gains from the reconstruction were substantial. On average, the rendering time was decreased by 73% (175.0ms to 47.6ms). Time from submission to the end of render was decreased by 90% (190.7ms to 18.7ms). However, these gains were not consistent accross the board. Scheduling times were increased from 14.1ms to 50.6ms, though this isn't a complete statistic because the latter included many more data points and needed more time to execute. Also, the time to fetch/load the data was increased from 9.1ms to 111.7ms. The method of data propagation between the two explains this difference, backbone uses a RESTful API to call a JSON file while the original used a static formula. These performance decreases aren't important however because these are loading times. What's important is that the UX and UI benefits from the performance gains, which the user will ultimately will experience. Hope that makes sense.</p>
